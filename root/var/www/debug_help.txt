Config:
2 [log]		- log mode (see log section)
3 [mode]	- fly mode (0-stab, 1-acro)
4 [gyro_o]	- gyro orientation; this is a single value that represent gyro orientation
5-8 [pin]	- motor pin (front-left, back-left, front-right, back-right)
17 [pwm]	- standby throttle - this value will be fed to motors when on stadby
18 [pwm]	- start throttle threshold - should be set to around 5% above standby throttle

70-224		- PID configurations

Debug:
249 [v]		- AVR ping; sends back the same message
250-253 [pwm]	- feed PWM to motor (front-left, back-left, front-right, back-right); motor needs to be initialized
		  Note: this is intended to work when AVR status is 1
254 [motor]	- init motor (0-FL, 1-BL, 2-FR, 3-BR); motor pin needs to be provided before
		  Note: this is intended to work when AVR status is 1
255 0		- get AVR status
255 1		- get AVR number of SPI crc errors 
255 2		- arm motors (status = 2); this should only be executed after configuration! (double check item 17 & 18)
255 254		- dummy
255 255		- reboot AVR

Run:
10 [yaw]	- desired yaw rate
11 [pitch]	- desired pitch
12 [roll]	- desired roll
13 [throttle]	- desired throttle
14 [alt]	- feed recent altitude measurement in cm
15 0/1		- engage/disengage altitude hold
16 [val]	- change target altitude by [val] in cm

Status reponses:
0		- early init
1		- awaiting config or command
2		- arm motors
3		- initialize mpu
4		- calibrate gyro
5		- running
253		- loop execution failure - mpu error (mpu fifo full?)  
254		- loop execution failure due to lag (avr is flooded with messages?) 
255		- gyro calibration failed 


Received values:
20-23 		- accel reading min (g-force) multiplied by 1000;
25-27		- accel reading max (g-force) multiplied by 1000;

1-3		- gyro reading; multiplied by 100; (yaw, pitch, roll);

5-8		- quaternion reading; multiplied by 100; (yaw, pitch, roll, yaw target);

10-13		- motor calculated PWM
